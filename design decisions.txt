1. The use of callback functions with the readFile that is ascynch.
Control is not returned to anywhere thus the program has time to go

one res render exists and multiple async options are possible.

2. The DOM loads only the necessary java script elements that are respective to contributing users and non. For example in the movie seciton
the edit movie js is not loaded (even in the pug) unless the user is of type contributing. This minimizes the amount of overhead to generate a page
and keeps things limited in scope

3. API does not return a password for a user to keep it safe.

4. Frequent collaborators is only the top 5 of the most frequently worked together actors.

5. For later; Have the user be able to add in a profile picture for their account

6. Design decision. The notifications require the user to do something since the thing updates each time.
